# awsSDKCRUD

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# To run the app in your machine you have to install docker first
Then you need to pull two images which can be done by this two commands 
sudo docker pull amishainnogeeks/sdkfrontend
sudo docker pull amishainnogeeks/sdkbackend

Then to make container out of it use 
sudo docker run -p 3000:3000 --name <container name>  amishainnogeeks/sdkfrontend  for  client side app
sudo docker run --name  <container name> -p 3001:3001 -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<key> -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<key> amishainnogeeks/sdkbackend
Your app will be running if you will fill the aws credentials in the last command!
